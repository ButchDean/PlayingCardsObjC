# PlayingCardsObjC
Objective-C implementation of the playing cards. I believe this is the shortest implementation I have found, and there is no use of strings for the card creation and manipulation code bar the text notifying what card has been dealt.

This was written on Ubuntu and can be easily modified for iOS.

I've also written versions in [Java](https://github.com/ButchDean/CardDeck) and [C++](https://github.com/ButchDean/PlayingCardsCPP).
